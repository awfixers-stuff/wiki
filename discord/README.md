# Discord Guides

#### What is Discord?

Discord is a versatile instant messaging and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) platform that brings people together for seamless communication, whether through text, voice, video, or screen sharing. Originally designed with gamers in mind, it has evolved into a vibrant hub for all kinds of communities, from friends chatting casually to large groups collaborating on projects, sharing interests, or even organizing events. At its core, Discord offers customizable servers—persistent chat rooms where users can create channels for specific topics, host live audio discussions, and integrate fun features like emojis, bots, and activities. It's free to use, with optional premium subscriptions like Discord Nitro that unlock extras such as animated avatars, higher-quality streaming, and custom profiles. As of 2025, Discord boasts around 150 million monthly active users and 19 million weekly active servers, making it one of the most popular platforms for building and nurturing online connections. Its positive impact shines through in how it fosters creativity, friendship, and community engagement, helping users stay connected in meaningful ways.

#### A Brief History of Discord

Discord's story is one of innovation and remarkable growth, starting from humble beginnings and blossoming into a global phenomenon. Founded in May 2015 by Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy in San Francisco, the platform was born out of a passion to solve communication frustrations in multiplayer games like Final Fantasy XIV and League of Legends. Citron, who had previously built successful ventures like OpenFeint, teamed up with Vishnevskiy to create a tool that prioritized ease of use, low performance impact, and reliable voice chat—qualities that quickly won over gamers.

The early years were marked by rapid adoption: By 2016, Discord had raised $20 million in funding and integrated with platforms like Twitch, attracting esports enthusiasts and gaming communities. It expanded partnerships, such as adding Xbox Live support in 2018 and securing major investments from companies like Tencent and WarnerMedia. The COVID-19 pandemic supercharged its popularity, with monthly active users doubling to 140 million by 2021 as people turned to Discord for virtual hangouts, remote work, and social events. In a smart pivot, Discord broadened its appeal beyond gaming in 2020, rebranding with the welcoming slogan "Your place to talk" and introducing features like Stage Channels for live talks and Threads for organized discussions.

Throughout the 2020s, Discord continued to innovate positively, acquiring tools for better moderation, enhancing user safety, and rolling out monetization options like Server Boosts to empower communities. By 2025, it reached impressive milestones, including a new CEO, Humam Sakhnini, to guide its future, and features like the Checkpoint year-in-review, which celebrates users' activities—such as messages sent, voice chat time, and favorite emojis—in a fun, personalized recap to mark its 10th anniversary. This growth reflects Discord's commitment to user-centric evolution, positively impacting diverse groups, from stock traders to activists organizing global events, and solidifying its role as a joyful space for connection.

#### Discord Bots: Enhancing Communities with Automation and Fun

Discord bots are delightful automated programs that add layers of functionality, interactivity, and personalization to servers, making communities more engaging and efficient. Think of them as helpful sidekicks that can handle tasks like moderating chats, playing music, running polls, or even fetching real-time information—all while integrating seamlessly into your Discord experience.

Bots work by connecting to Discord's API and Gateway system, which allows them to listen for events (like new messages or user joins) in real time via secure WebSocket connections. This setup enables bots to respond instantly, whether it's welcoming new members, enforcing rules, or creating custom games. Popular uses include moderation bots that keep conversations positive and on-topic, entertainment bots for trivia or memes, and utility bots for reminders or integrations with other services like weather updates or news feeds. Over 430,000 active bots are used in about 30% of servers, showcasing their widespread appeal and the creativity they inspire.

Creating a bot is an exciting opportunity for developers and hobbyists alike. You start by registering an application in the Discord Developer Portal to get a bot token, then use programming languages like JavaScript or Python to build its logic. Libraries simplify the process, letting you focus on innovative features that bring joy to users. The beauty of bots lies in how they empower communities to tailor their spaces, fostering stronger bonds and endless possibilities for fun and productivity.

#### The Discord API: A Gateway to Developer Creativity

The Discord API is a powerful, developer-friendly toolkit that opens up endless opportunities to build apps, bots, and integrations, enriching the platform for millions of users. At its heart, the API provides access to core elements like channels, guilds (servers), users, and messages, allowing creators to craft custom experiences such as interactive commands, real-time games, or social features in external apps.

Key features include Interactions for handling slash commands and button responses, Components for building dynamic messages with buttons or modals, and Webhooks for efficient event notifications. The Gateway API complements this by enabling real-time event streaming, perfect for bots that need to react instantly to server activities. Developers can also leverage the Embedded App SDK for in-Discord games and the Social SDK (introduced in 2025) for adding voice chat and presence to cross-platform titles, making it easier to create immersive, social multiplayer experiences.

The API's positive aspects shine in its support for monetization through subscriptions and in-app purchases, helping developers turn ideas into sustainable projects. With comprehensive documentation and a welcoming community, it's designed to spark innovation, enabling everything from simple bots to full-fledged apps that enhance discovery, engagement, and fun on Discord. As of 2025, ongoing updates continue to make it more accessible, empowering creators to build vibrant, connected worlds.
