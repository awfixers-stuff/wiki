# The Golden Rule

#### Summary

The **Golden Rule** is a fundamental ethical principle often summarized as: "Treat others as you would like to be treated" (positive form) or "Do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself" (negative form). It promotes empathy, reciprocity, and mutual respect, serving as a simple guide for moral behavior across personal, social, and intercultural interactions.

#### History

The Golden Rule is one of the most ancient and widespread ethical ideas in human history, appearing independently in many cultures and traditions as far back as antiquity.

* **Earliest known expressions**: Traces date to ancient Egypt (c. 2040–1782 BCE) in _The Tale of the Eloquent Peasant_, which advises doing good to others to encourage reciprocity.
* **Ancient Eastern traditions**: Confucius (c. 551–479 BCE) formulated it negatively: "What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others." Similar negative forms appear in Hinduism (Mahabharata), Buddhism (Udanavarga: "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful"), Jainism, and Zoroastrianism.
* **Judaism**: A negative version appears in Leviticus 19:18 ("Love your neighbor as yourself") and is emphasized by Rabbi Hillel (c. 1st century BCE): "What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow."
* **Christianity**: Jesus presented it positively in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 7:12): "In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets." A similar version appears in Luke 6:31.
* **Islam**: A hadith states: "Do unto all men as you would wish to have done unto you."
* **Other traditions**: Variations exist in Daoism, Sikhism, indigenous African philosophies (e.g., Ubuntu), and pre-Islamic Arab ethics.

The term "**Golden Rule**" itself emerged in the early 17th century in Britain among Anglican theologians, reflecting its perceived value as a "golden" or supreme moral law. By the 20th century, it was recognized as a near-universal principle, featured in interfaith declarations like the 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions' "Declaration Toward a Global Ethic."

#### Explanation

The Golden Rule is an **ethic of reciprocity** rooted in empathy: it asks individuals to imagine themselves in another's position and act accordingly. Psychologically, it leverages self-interest—people naturally avoid harm to themselves—to extend fairness to others. Philosophically, it challenges egocentrism and promotes equality by implying all people deserve similar treatment.

* **Positive vs. negative forms**: The positive ("do unto others") encourages active kindness, while the negative ("do not do") focuses on avoiding harm. Jesus' positive formulation is seen as more proactive.
* **Strengths**: Its simplicity and universality make it intuitive and applicable across cultures, fostering cooperation and reducing conflict. It aligns with concepts like human rights and compassion.
* **Criticisms**: Philosophers note potential flaws, such as if someone has unusual desires (e.g., masochists wanting harm), it could justify wrong actions. It also assumes shared preferences, which may not hold across diverse cultures or individuals.
* **Modern relevance**: It underpins secular ethics, interpersonal skills, and global calls for tolerance. Some view it as evidence of innate human morality, possibly linked to evolutionary cooperation.

Overall, the Golden Rule endures as a timeless bridge for ethical understanding in a diverse world.
