# AWFixer Wiki

I will make guides here for things that I do that i think we should have guides about.

For example the Docs for Wickbot suck, so I will make a guide for how to use Wickbot here, I have mastered many aspects of it recently and wish to share that with the world.



I will share how to use Ghost, how to use Gitbook and also how to deal with internet hate because all these things are cool.
